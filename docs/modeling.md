# Modeling and API Simulation

Topograph models are YAML files used to simulate discovered topology without querying a real cloud API, NetQ instance, InfiniBand fabric, or Kubernetes cluster. They are primarily used by tests and local development, but they are also useful when validating a scheduler integration against known topology shapes.

A model describes the same canonical topology that real providers eventually produce:

- A variable-depth switch tree, used for Slurm `topology/tree` output and Kubernetes `fabric.topograph.run/tier-N` labels
- Node membership in an accelerator domain and optional sub-domain, used for block topology and the `accelerator.topograph.run/domain` and `accelerator.topograph.run/sub-domain` labels
- Optional per-node labels and provider-specific annotations used by provider simulations

Model loading lives in `pkg/models`. Model fixtures live under `tests/models/`.

## Where Models Are Used

Models are consumed in several simulation and local-development flows.

### KWOK Clusters

`kwok-nodes` renders virtual Kubernetes `Node` objects from a model file as a plain YAML manifest. The helper script `scripts/create-kind-kwok-cluster.sh` then creates or reuses a local kind cluster, installs KWOK into it, and applies that manifest. This is useful when you want to run Topograph against a Kubernetes API without provisioning real nodes.

Prerequisites:

- `kind` installed and available on `PATH`
- `kubectl` installed and available on `PATH`
- A Docker-compatible runtime supported by kind
- Network access to GitHub releases when installing KWOK manifests

Build the manifest renderer:

```bash
make build
```

Render a KWOK node manifest from one of the embedded model fixtures:

```bash
bin/kwok-nodes -model medium.yaml -output /tmp/kwok-nodes.yaml
```

Create or reuse a kind cluster named `topograph`, install KWOK, and apply the generated nodes:

```bash
scripts/create-kind-kwok-cluster.sh -m medium.yaml
```

Create or reuse a named kind cluster from an explicit model path, and keep the generated manifest:

```bash
scripts/create-kind-kwok-cluster.sh \
  --cluster topo-demo \
  --model tests/models/nvl72.yaml \
  --output /tmp/nvl72-kwok-nodes.yaml \
  --gpus 8
```

To pass a kind cluster configuration file, add `--kind-config path/to/kind.yaml`. To pin KWOK installation to a release, add `--kwok-release vX.Y.Z`; otherwise the script uses GitHub's latest KWOK release download URL.

The utility uses the model-derived instance-to-hostname mapping, so model hostname `1101` becomes Kubernetes node `1101` with:

- `topograph.run/instance: i-1101`
- `topograph.run/region: <derived-region-or-none>`
- `kwok.x-k8s.io/node=fake` as both a label and annotation
- Model-derived labels such as `topology.kubernetes.io/region` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
- Model-derived annotations such as `accelerator.topology.test/domain`

Generated Kubernetes node names come from model hostnames and are normalized to valid lowercase DNS names. For example, model hostname `I21` becomes Kubernetes node `i21`, while its generated instance ID `i-I21` is stored in `topograph.run/instance`.

The script applies the manifest with kubeconfig context `kind-<cluster>`, matching the context name created by `kind create cluster --name=<cluster>`.

### Test Provider

The `test` provider simulates the Topograph API lifecycle itself. It can return successful topology output, delayed completion, malformed-request failures, provider failures, or a request that remains pending.

Use it when testing clients that call:

- `POST /v1/generate`
- `GET /v1/topology?uid=<request-id>`

For the complete API status-code simulation behavior, see [Test Mode and Test Provider](./providers/test.md).

### Provider Simulations

Several providers also have simulation variants, such as:

- `aws-sim`
- `gcp-sim`
- `oci-sim`
- `nebius-sim`
- `nscale-sim`
- `lambdai-sim`
- `dsx-sim`
- `lldp-sim`

Most of these providers load a model file and then simulate that provider's API responses. This is useful when you want to exercise the normal provider translation logic without real provider credentials or infrastructure. `lldp-sim` instead replays a raw `lldpctl -f json` document configured through `lldpFileName`; see the [LLDP provider reference](./providers/lldp.md#lldp-sim-saved-output).

The model-backed simulation providers share these common parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `modelFileName` | Yes | Model file to load. A basename such as `medium.yaml` is loaded from `tests/models/`; absolute and relative paths are also supported. |
| `api_error` | No | Provider-specific test hook used by unit tests to simulate API failures. |
| `trimTiers` | No | Number of topology tiers to trim where supported by the simulated provider. |

Example request:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "name": "aws-sim",
    "params": {
      "modelFileName": "medium.yaml"
    }
  },
  "engine": {
    "name": "slurm",
    "params": {
      "plugin": "topology/block"
    }
  }
}
```

## Model File Shape

A model usually has one required top-level section and one optional topology section:

```yaml
blocks:
  - ...
switches:
  ...
```

`switches` is a map and `blocks` is a list. `blocks[].nodes` is where model files declare compute node names; it creates the node records, applies block labels and annotations, and optionally attaches those nodes to a leaf switch through `blocks[].switch`. `switches` may be omitted for block-only models.

## Switches

The `switches` map describes the network hierarchy. Each key is the switch ID. Each value may contain:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `labels` | Labels inherited by descendant nodes. Common keys are `topology.kubernetes.io/region` and `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`. |
| `annotations` | Provider-specific simulation metadata inherited by descendant nodes. Use `accelerator.topology.test/domain` for accelerator-domain membership and, where supported, `accelerator.topology.test/sub-domain` for a nested accelerator grouping. |
| `switches` | Child switch IDs. |

Example:

```yaml
switches:
  core:
    labels:
      topology.kubernetes.io/region: us-west
    switches: [spine]
  spine:
    labels:
      topology.kubernetes.io/zone: zone1
    switches: [leaf1, leaf2]
```

Switch rules:

- A switch can have at most one parent switch.
- Empty leaf switches may be omitted from the `switches` map. A child switch named in a parent's `switches` list is created automatically when it has no top-level definition.
- A switch that defines labels, annotations, or child switches must have a top-level entry.
- If a block names a switch with `blocks[].switch`, that block's `nodes` are attached to the switch before switch validation runs.

## Blocks

The `blocks` list describes sets of compute instances with similar hardware and connectivity characteristics. Each entry may contain:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `switch` | Optional leaf switch ID. When set, this block's `nodes` are attached to that switch. |
| `nodes` | Required non-empty list of hostnames in this block. Compact ranges are supported. The model-backed test provider generates each instance ID by prefixing the hostname with `i-`. |
| `labels` | Optional node labels applied to nodes generated from this block. |
| `annotations` | Optional provider-specific simulation metadata applied to nodes generated from this block. Use `accelerator.topology.test/domain` to identify an accelerator domain. |

Example:

```yaml
blocks:
- switch: leaf1
  nodes: ["n[1-2]"]
  annotations:
    accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl1
```

Block rules:

- The `blocks` section is the only place model files declare compute node names.
- Each block entry must declare at least one node.
- `switch` is optional. When set, it must reference a switch declared at the top level or named as a child in the switch hierarchy.
- `blocks[].nodes` creates node entries automatically.

## Compact Ranges

Model node lists support compact ranges:

```yaml
blocks:
- nodes: ["n[1-4]", "gpu[001-004]", node9]
```

These expand to:

```text
n1, n2, n3, n4, gpu001, gpu002, gpu003, gpu004, node9
```

Ranges are accepted in:

- `blocks[].nodes`

## Derived Data

After YAML parsing, Topograph completes the model before simulation uses it:

- Compact ranges in Capacity block node ranges are expanded.
- Block `switch` references attach block nodes to switches.
- Switch names are copied from their map keys.
- Nodes are created from `blocks[].nodes`.
- Node `NetLayers` is derived from the switch path from leaf to root.
- Node labels are built by merging labels from the switch path and block labels.
- Node annotations are built by merging annotations from the switch path and block annotations.
- `Instances` is derived from node names and grouped by `labels.topology.kubernetes.io/region`; nodes without a region use `none`.

These derived fields are not written in YAML.

## Complete Examples

### Blocks With Switches

This model creates nodes from block membership and attaches them to a leaf switch.

```yaml
switches:
  core:
    switches: [leaf]

blocks:
- switch: leaf
  nodes: ["n[1-2]"]
  annotations:
    accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl1
- switch: leaf
  nodes: [n3]
  annotations:
    accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl2
```

After loading:

- `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` are hostnames mapped from instance IDs `i-n1`, `i-n2`, and `i-n3`
- `n1` and `n2` belong to the first block and have the `accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl1` annotation
- `n3` belongs to the second block and has the `accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl2` annotation
- All three nodes have network layers `[leaf, core]`

### Blocks Without Switches

This model omits `switches`. Nodes are still created, block metadata is still applied, and generated instances have no network layers.

```yaml
blocks:
- nodes: ["n[1-2]"]
  annotations:
    accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl1
```

After loading:

- `n1` and `n2` belong to the first block
- `n1` and `n2` have the `accelerator.topology.test/domain: nvl1` annotation
- `n1` and `n2` have no network layers

## Simulating the API

To simulate the Topograph API lifecycle, configure the `test` provider:

```yaml
http:
  port: 49021
  ssl: false

provider: test
engine: slurm

requestAggregationDelay: 2s
```

Then submit a request that names a model:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "name": "test",
    "params": {
      "generateResponseCode": 202,
      "topologyResponseCode": 200,
      "modelFileName": "small-tree.yaml"
    }
  },
  "engine": {
    "name": "slurm"
  }
}
```

Expected flow:

1. `POST /v1/generate` returns `202 Accepted` and a request ID.
2. `GET /v1/topology?uid=<request-id>` returns `202 Accepted` while the request is queued or processing.
3. When processing completes, `/v1/topology` returns `200 OK` with the selected engine output.

To simulate API failures, set `generateResponseCode`, `topologyResponseCode`, and `errorMessage` in `provider.params`. For example:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "name": "test",
    "params": {
      "generateResponseCode": 202,
      "topologyResponseCode": 500,
      "errorMessage": "simulated provider failure"
    }
  },
  "engine": {
    "name": "slurm"
  }
}
```

## Choosing the Right Simulation Path

Use the `test` provider when you want to validate API-client behavior:

- Request IDs
- Polling
- Pending responses
- Error status codes
- Retry behavior

Use a `*-sim` provider when you want to validate provider-specific topology translation:

- AWS, GCP, OCI, Nebius, Nscale, Lambda AI, or DSX topology paths
- Pagination behavior in simulated provider APIs
- Engine output generated from provider-shaped data
- Tree and block topology output from the same model

## Validation Checklist

Before using a new model in a regression test:

- Confirm every switch child has only one parent.
- Confirm every block `switch` reference points at an existing switch.
- Confirm no node appears under two blocks.
- Run the relevant provider simulation test or API flow with the target engine.
