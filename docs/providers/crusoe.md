# Crusoe Topology Provider

The Crusoe provider discovers the InfiniBand switch fabric of a
[Crusoe Cloud](https://crusoe.ai/) Kubernetes cluster from labels the Crusoe
control plane writes on every Node. It uses in-cluster service account auth, so
no credentials are required.

Crusoe compute is virtualized. A guest VM cannot run `ibnetdiscover` against the
fabric, and there is no per-node metadata service that reports switch identity.
The control plane instead publishes each VM's fabric position as Node labels, so
the provider only has to read the Kubernetes API.

## When to Use This Provider

Use it on Crusoe Cloud, including Crusoe Managed Kubernetes. On any other
platform use the provider that matches it — see
[Choosing a Provider](../overview.md).

The provider supplies the switch fabric hierarchy. Pair it with
`topology/tree`.

## How It Works

1. Lists Nodes, filtered by `nodeSelector` when one is set.
2. Reads `crusoe.ai/ib.partition.id` and `crusoe.ai/pod.id` from each Node and
   turns them into fabric tiers.
3. Returns the canonical graph.

### Fabric tiers

Tiers are closest-first, so tier 0 is nearest the compute node:

| Tier | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `crusoe.ai/pod.id` | Rail-optimized pod — hosts wired to a shared set of InfiniBand leaf switches, one per GPU rail |
| 1 | `crusoe.ai/ib.partition.id` | InfiniBand partition — the isolated fabric the pod belongs to |
| 2 | `crusoe` | A synthetic root above every partition |

The root tier is not a switch. Slurm needs one common ancestor so a job can
span partitions, and so nodes with no InfiniBand still belong to the tree.

### Nodes without InfiniBand

Nodes that carry neither label get the placeholder tiers `cpu-pod` and
`cpu-partition` under the same root. That keeps them schedulable in one Slurm
tree alongside the InfiniBand nodes.

A node the request names but the `nodeSelector` excludes has no tiers at all, so
it appears under `no-topology` in the generated file rather than disappearing.

## Prerequisites

- A Crusoe Cloud Kubernetes cluster
- Nodes labelled by the Crusoe control plane with `crusoe.ai/ib.partition.id`
  and `crusoe.ai/pod.id`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nodeSelector` | `map[string]string` | No | Label selector limiting which Nodes take part. Omit it and every Node in the cluster is included. |
| `trimTiers` | `int` | No | Drop this many tiers from the top of the fabric path. `0`–`2`. |

## Configuration

Select the provider through the Helm chart. A Slurm-on-Kubernetes cluster pairs
it with the [Slinky engine](../engines/slinky.md):

```yaml
provider:
  name: crusoe
  params:
    nodeSelector:
      slurm.crusoe.ai/compute-node-type: "true"

engine:
  name: slinky
  params:
    namespace: slurm
    plugin: topology/tree
    topologyConfigmapName: slurm-topology
    topologyConfigPath: topology.conf
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: compute
```

Set a `nodeSelector` on a shared cluster. Without one, control-plane and system
nodes land in `cpu-partition` and appear in `topology.conf`.

No credentials are required. The provider uses the in-cluster service account.

## Verifying the Output

Check that the labels are present before generating topology:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '.items[] | {
  name: .metadata.name,
  partition: .metadata.labels["crusoe.ai/ib.partition.id"],
  pod: .metadata.labels["crusoe.ai/pod.id"]
}'
```

A `404` from topology generation means no requested node matched the selector.
Confirm the `nodeSelector` and the instance list in the request.

Read back the generated file:

```bash
kubectl get configmap slurm-topology -n slurm -o jsonpath='{.data.topology\.conf}'
```

## Simulation

`crusoe-sim` renders topology from a model file instead of a live cluster. The
model attaches Crusoe labels to switches and the loader propagates them to the
nodes, so the simulation runs the same code as production. See
`tests/models/crusoe-small.yaml`, which covers two InfiniBand partitions plus
nodes with no InfiniBand labels.
